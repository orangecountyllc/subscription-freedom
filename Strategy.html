      <h1 class="plansHero__title">Strategy  </h1>

      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">  I’m not sure “Freedom” is the best name. It’s not very catchy or easy to build a community around—like “Amazonians” for Amazon. “Freedomers” doesn’t really work.
        Since we’ll have standout features like alerts (similar to Waze), a strong name that’s simple and natural to say could really help it stick.
        What do you think? </p>

      <br><br>
        <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> Now I am thinking of name : Free Birds, & slowly people will start calling the 
          drivers as Bird,   Just like people say ‘Ubering,’ even when they are lyfting, ( lol ) younger users could say ‘I’m birding’ or ‘Let me call a bird.’, Or my bird will be here soon. 
          
          I am getting a bird. Just get a bird. <br>  Bird signifies freedom (from uber). Emotional Resonance: The name taps into a universal desire for liberation, especially for drivers frustrated with Uber/Lyft’s high commissions and rigid systems.
        & its uplifting.   
        <br><br>
      The best part is I was looking for a name that is short that can be used in the cars (govt require it), in this case we can use just the symbol bird.  
    
      <br><br>
        But there is another name reegistered with Bird — Ride Electric.  We'll figure it out. 
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">There are many drivers in other states/cities looking for a service like this.  </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">I think our strategy should be to get them ( riders + drivers ) to sign up early, so when we launch, we already have 200 drivers or 100 riders ready to go.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">Our focus should be on building a strong foundation for success, not just short-term revenue. </p>
      <br><br>
      
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">
       >  A rider mentioned me that  Metro riders would be great marketing targets! bc those are the peopel who either take Metro to DC or use Uber or Empower on daily basis. 
        <br> and many of them dont even know about empower , bc empower really dont put much effort into marketing. 
        
        I’ve heard that a strong slogan could be: ‘Did you know your Uber driver only gets 50% of what you pay?’ People in DC and NY often like to support local drivers and small businesses
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      

     
      <br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left">
        We need attract riders (& drivers ) before launch—otherwise, drivers won’t be motivated, especially if there’s no demand to justify the cost of commercial insurance.  
      </p>

      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> Let’s think about how apps like these went viral and apply similar ideas.    
      </p>

      <br>
      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> </p>
      <br>

      <p class="plansHero__subtitle_left"> >  Maybe we should consider <b> different pricing for different areas.</b> 
        
        In DC, Empower has taken over by offering super low prices—even though it’s technically illegal and doesn’t offer insurance. 
        
        Most people don’t realize that, and it puts us at a disadvantage unless we can match their pricing.

<h2>✅ What You’re Doing Well  ( jay - I got it analyzed ) </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong driver-first messaging (fee reductions, tip transparency)</li>
    <li>Clear rider discounts and reward structure</li>
    <li>Smart use of gamified referral leaderboard</li>
    <li>Use of minimum user count to unlock city launches, building anticipation</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>🔧 Suggestions to Strengthen Your Viral Strategy</h2>

  <h3>1. Launch with Community Champions (Ambassadors)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Recruit driver and rider ambassadors in each city.</li>
    <li>Offer perks (swag, waived fees, exclusive access) in exchange for helping onboard others.</li>
    <li>Use tools like WhatsApp/Telegram groups to build local momentum.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Create a Waitlist with Visibility</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Like Robinhood,  <u>show users how close they are to getting access. </u></li>
    <li style="color: blue;" >Refer more to move up” can increase viral spread.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Partner with Facebook Groups / Reddit Communities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Target: rideshare drivers (Uber subreddits, FB groups), moms (for family booking), <span style="color: blue;"> college students.  ( how - they only want cheap/ free </span></li>
    <li>Offer special codes to group members with public leaderboards.  ( ? How does that help ? ) </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Time-Limited Referral Multipliers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For the first 2–4 weeks: “Every referral counts as 2.”</li>
    <li>Or: “Refer 5 in 5 days, get $25 in ride credits.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Make it About “Taking Back Control”</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Market to drivers as a driver liberation movement (freedom from Uber fees).</li>
    <li>Use storytelling from real drivers (maybe even TikToks or reels).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Launch Campaign Theme</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: “Freedom Week” → city-wide countdown to unlock launch.</li>
    <li>Post daily signup updates to create FOMO. <span style="color: blue;">  ( fear of missing out ) </span> </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Memes and Shareable Content</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a meme/social toolkit for drivers and riders to share.</li>
    <li>Think funny comparisons of Uber vs Freedom App (fees, tips, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
